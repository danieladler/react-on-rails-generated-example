# README

This is a sample app built with the react_on_rails generator, per the 
[react-on-rails setup tutorial](https://shakacode.gitbooks.io/react-on-rails/content/docs/tutorial.html).

I'm using this as a bare-bones config example for a pre-existing Rails app where I'll be porting in [react-on-rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) midstream.
